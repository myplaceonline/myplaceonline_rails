# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        # Frequently Asked Questions
        
        ## General

        ### <a name="theory"></a>What is the theory of the categories?
        
        > ‚ÄòHappiness' is too worn and too weary a term to be of much scientific use, and the discipline of Positive Psychology divides it into three very different realms, each of which is measurable and, most importantly, each of which is skill-based and can be taught (Seligman, 2002). The first is hedonic: positive emotion (joy, love, contentment, pleasure etc.). A life led around having as much of this good stuff as possible, is the ‚ÄòPleasant Life'. The second, much closer to what Thomas Jefferson and Aristotle sought, is the state of flow, and a life led around it is the ‚ÄòEngaged Life'. Flow, a major part of the Engaged Life, consists in a loss of self-consciousness, time stopping for you, being ‚Äòone with the music' (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Importantly engagement seems to be the opposite of positive emotion: when one is totally absorbed, no thoughts or feelings are present‚Äîeven though one says afterwards ‚Äòthat was fun' (Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005). And while there are shortcuts to positive emotion‚Äîyou can take drugs, masturbate, watch television, or go shopping‚Äîthere are no shortcuts to flow. Flow only occurs when you deploy your highest strengths and talents to meet the challenges that come your way, and it is clear that flow facilitates learning. The third realm in the framework of Positive Psychology is the one with the best intellectual provenance, the Meaningful Life. Flow and positive emotion can be found in solipsistic pursuits, but not meaning or purpose. Meaning is increased through our connections to others, future generations, or causes that transcend the self (Durkheim, 1951/1897; Erikson, 1963). From a Positive Psychology perspective, meaning consists in knowing what your highest strengths are, and then using them to belong to and serve something you believe is larger than the self (Seligman, 2002).

        ### What is the purpose of the points system?
        
        The points system is an experiment to try to help people balance the three dimensions of happiness mentioned above.
        
        ### How safe is my data?
        
        Regarding the availability of your data, it is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is asynchronously but nearly instantaneously streamed to a backup database (see [our architecture](https://github.com/myplaceonline/myplaceonline/blob/master/doc/Development.md#architecture)). If the main database server crashes, your data will most likely be safe. The only potential danger of losing your data is if something happens to the entire [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) San Francisco data center because the architecture is currently limited to a single data center.
        
        If you are concerned that your data is stored in the United States, you may use symmetric encryption for certain sensitive data (see the `Security` section below), or run the website locally.
        
        ## <a name="security"></a>Security
        
        ### How are website passwords managed?
        
        We never store your website password on our servers. A bcrypt [hash and salt](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) for the password is stored and used to authenticate you. Your password is stored in an [encrypted and signed form in your cookie](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CookieStore.html). This is needed because your password is used to decrypt any values you chose to encrypt, and asking you for your password every time something needs to be decrypted would be annoying.
        
        When you change your password, we symmetrically decrypt all encrypted values and then re-encrypt them with the new password. This can take a long time if you have a lot of encrypted values.
        
        ### How is encryption used?
        
        You may optionally encrypt some sensitive information, usually by checking an `Encrypt` checkbox when creating or editing certain items such as passwords (this box is checked by default). This protects that data from the following attacks (assuming your password is hard to discover using a brute force search):
        
        * If a malicious person hacks the Myplaceonline database.
        * If a Myplaceonline administrator reads the database.
        * If another Myplaceonline user accesses your data by exploiting a bug in the website to access your data (the reason this fails is that even if the user accesses your data, unless you both happened to use the same password, the decryption will return garbage).
        
        ### How is data encrypted when stored in the database or in offline browser storage?

        Symmetric [AES-256-CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and a [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)+HMAC+SHA1 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### How is data encrypted when exported?

        When [exporting all of your data](/users/export) into a downloadable file, you may optionally encrypt the file using symmetric [AES-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and an [S2K](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)+SHA512 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### What are the issues with "at-rest" encryption?
        
        At-rest encryption uses your main Myplaceonline.com website password to encrypt the data in the database using a [symmetric cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) (see above). This means that if you forget your main Myplaceonline.com website password, you will not be able to recover those encrypted values (because only you had the key). The "forgot my password" function on websites simply resets your password to a new password after you click a link in an email. There is no such thing as a "forgot my password" function for symmetric encryption.
        
        ### If I sign out of Myplaceonline, why are all my other devices also signed out?
        
        This is a security feature. If you want to stay logged in on other devices, then do not use the sign out feature; instead, on the devices that you want to sign out of, do not check the "Remember Me" box when signing in, and simply close the browser when you want to sign out. This will sign you out on just that device.

        ## Sharing
        
        You may share a trip and its pictures through email:
        
        1. Create a [trip](/trips/new) and give it a location and start date.
        Add one or more pictures to the trip. After saving, click the `Share`
        button at the bottom. For example:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/create_trip1.png}
        
        1. Select which pictures to share. By default, all pictures are
        shared. When finished selecting, click the `Share` button at the
        bottom:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share1.png}
        
        1. Enter a subject and body of the email. For the subject, we recommend
        starting it with `Name Shared: `, and we'll add that by default. The
        reason for this is that the email will come from this website
        so it may be useful for the recipient to quickly know who sent the email
        without having to check it. For the body, you may use the
        placeholder `%{name}` which will be replaced by the contact name.
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share2.png}
        
        1. If you plan to share with the same group of people in the future,
        create a group:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share4.png}
        
        1. Click `New Group` and enter a group name (next time, search for
        this name in the `Existing Group` box):
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share5.png}
        
        1. Add as many contacts as you want. For each contact, click
        `New Contact`, enter at least a first name, and then add one or more
        email addresses (this is where the system will send the emails).
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share6.png}
        
        1. Instead of using groups, you can add individual contacts as well.
        These are not mutually exclusive, so you can select one or more groups
        as well as one or more contacts, and emails will be sent to all of them.
        Click `Share` at the bottom when ready.
        
        1. On the next page, you may uncheck any contacts that you do not
        want to email. This is useful if you use a group and you want to
        exclude some people for some reason. In addition, you can add a
        personalization to any checked person and this additional text will
        be put at the bottom of the email just for that person. Click `Share`
        when complete:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share7.png}
        
        1. In about 5 minutes, the emails will be sent to the contacts.
        Remember that we cannot guarantee email delivery. Even if you
        blind carbon copy yourself and receive a copy, we do not track email
        opens so you can never be sure the email arrived or was opened. The
        email will be addressed from our domain although a `Reply-To`
        is setup so that if the person clicks reply, they will automatically
        reply to your email address. The user will have a link to the shared
        trip view. This link has a unique token so that only they, or anyone
        they forward the link to, can see the page. Thumbnails of the images
        will also be included in the HTML version of the email. The user
        is able to unsubscribe from `Trip` emails or all emails from you.
        By default, the signature at the bottom will only include your email
        address. If you want your name and/or phone numbers in the signature,
        go to the [contacts](/contacts) page and click on the `Me` button
        to edit your contact.

      <![CDATA[
      # Privacy Policy

      Your privacy is critically important to us. At ${HOST}, we have a few fundamental principles:

      *   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
      *   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
      *   We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
      *   We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
      *   We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

      Below is ${HOST}‚Äôs privacy policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles. (Note, this page is based on [Automattic's](https://automattic.com/privacy/) Creative Commons Sharealike privacy policy)

      ## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

      This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

      *   Our websites;
      *   Our mobile applications (including the ${HOST} mobile app for Android and iOS); and
      *   Other products and services that are available on or through our websites.

      Throughout this Privacy Policy we‚Äôll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as ‚ÄúServices.‚Äù

      Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

      Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.

      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please¬†[contact us](/info/contact).

      ## Information We Collect

      We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so‚Äìfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

      We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let‚Äôs go over the information that we collect.

      ### Information You Provide to Us

      It‚Äôs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

      *   **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a [${HOST}](/)¬†account to provide a username and email address‚Äìand that‚Äôs it. You may provide us with more information‚Äìlike your name‚Äìbut we don‚Äôt require that information to create your account.
      *   **Public Profile Information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a ${HOST} account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile. Your public profile is just that‚Äìpublic‚Äìso please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
      *   **Transaction and Billing Information:** If you buy something from us‚Äìa subscription to a ${HOST} plan for example‚Äìyou will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
      *   **Content Information:** Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in the draft and published content for your website. For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet, if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to you...but it‚Äôs not to everyone!
      *   **Credentials**: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).  
      *   **Communications with Us (Hi There!):** You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Support Engineers about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.

      ### Information We Collect Automatically

      We also collect some information automatically:

      *   **Log Information**: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services‚Äìfor example, when you create or make changes to your website on ${HOST}.
      *   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site‚Äìin other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [${HOST} username] deleted ‚Äú[title of post]‚Äù at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.
      *   **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system‚Äôs permissions.
      *   **Stored Information:** We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored information through your device operating system‚Äôs permissions. ¬†For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device‚Äôs camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
      *   **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor‚Äôs computer, and that the visitor‚Äôs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. ${HOST} uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.

      ### Information We Collect from Other Sources

      We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your ${HOST} account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter), we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.

      We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.

      ## How We Use Information

      We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:

      *   To provide our Services‚Äìfor example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, or charge you for any of our paid Services;
      *   To further develop our Services‚Äìfor example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
      *   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
      *   To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of ${HOST} and others;
      *   To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by ${HOST} and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on ${HOST} and our products; and
      *   To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations and serve relevant advertisements.

      ## Sharing Information

      ### _How We Share Information_

      We do not sell our users‚Äô private personal information.

      We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

      *   **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors**: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
      *   **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
      *   **As Required by Law:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
      *   **To Protect Rights and Property:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ${HOST}, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
      *   **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that ${HOST} goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
      *   **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so.
      *   **Aggregated and De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
      *   **Other Site Owners:** If you have a ${HOST} account and leave a comment on a site that uses our Services (like a site created on ${HOST}), your IP address and the email address associated with your ${HOST} account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.
      *   **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

      ### Information Shared Publicly

      Information that you choose to make public is‚Äìyou guessed it‚Äìdisclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and comments on other websites that use our Services, are all available to others‚Äìand we hope you get a lot of views! We provide a ‚ÄúFirehose‚Äù stream of public data (like posts and comments) from sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but do not have rights to re-publish it, publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.

      ## Security

      While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

      ## Choices

      You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

      *   **Limit the Information that You Provide**: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services‚Äìfor example, paid, premium themes‚Äìmay not be accessible.
      *   **Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:** Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).
      *   **Opt-Out of Electronic Communications**: You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
      *   **Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:** At this time, ${HOST} does not respond to ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using ${HOST}‚Äôs websites, with the drawback that certain features of ${HOST}‚Äôs websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

      ## Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)

      ### Transferring Information

      ${HOST} is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.

      ### Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others

      Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by ${HOST} and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.

      ### Third Party Software

      If you‚Äôd like to use third party software like plugins with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don‚Äôt own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.

      ### Our Users‚Äô Websites

      If you are a visitor to one of our users‚Äô websites‚Äìa self-hosted ${HOST} site, for example‚Äìplease note that this privacy policy doesn‚Äôt apply to you in regard to that specific site. We process information that visitors provide to our users‚Äô websites on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements.

        # Terms of Service
        
        <h2>The gist</h2>

        We (the folks at ${HOST}) run an online helper website called ${HOST} and would love for you to use it. ${HOST}'s basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features.

        (Note, this page is based on [Wordpress.com's](https://en.wordpress.com/tos/) Creative Commons Sharealike terms of service)
        
        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

        The following terms and conditions govern all use of the ${HOST} website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website (taken together, our Services). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, ${HOST}'s Privacy Policy). ${HOST} may change its Terms of Service from time to time, and in ${HOST}'s sole discretion. ${HOST} will send an email to all registered members when this happens and maintain a change log at the bottom of this page.

        Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by ${HOST}, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.

        Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.

        Use of our Services requires a ${HOST} account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.
        
        1. ${HOST}.
        * Your ${HOST} Account and Website. If you create an account on ${HOST}, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must immediately notify ${HOST} of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. ${HOST} will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
        * Responsibility of Contributors. If you post material ("Content") to ${HOST}.com and mark it as public, you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that your content does not violate these terms or the User Guidelines. If you delete Content, ${HOST} will use reasonable efforts to remove it from ${HOST}.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, ${HOST} has the right (though not the obligation) to, in ${HOST}'s sole discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of ${HOST}.com to any individual or entity for any reason. ${HOST} will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
        * Payment and Renewal.
          * General Terms: Optional paid services are available (any such services, an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay ${HOST} the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
          * Automatic Renewal: Unless you notify ${HOST} before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your website's dashboard.

        2. Responsibility of Visitors.
        ${HOST} has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By operating our Services, ${HOST} does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. ${HOST} disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.
        
        3. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.
        If you believe that material located on or linked to by ${HOST}.com violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify ${HOST}. ${HOST} will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. ${HOST} will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ${HOST} or others. In the case of such termination, ${HOST} will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to ${HOST}.
        
        4. Intellectual Property.
        This Agreement does not transfer from ${HOST} to you any ${HOST} or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with ${HOST}. ${HOST}, ${HOST}.com, the ${HOST}.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with ${HOST}.com or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of ${HOST} or ${HOST}'s licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any ${HOST} or third-party trademarks.
        
        5. Changes.
        We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
        
        6. Termination.
        ${HOST} may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If possible, we will notify you and offer your data for offline download. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your ${HOST}.com account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services or delete your account under settings. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranties.
        Our Services are provided "as is." ${HOST} and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither ${HOST} nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.
        In no event will ${HOST}, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to ${HOST} under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. ${HOST} shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
        
        9. General Representation and Warranty.
        You represent and warrant that (i) your use of our Services will be in strict accordance with the ${HOST} Privacy Policy, with this Agreement, and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of our Services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.
        
        10. US Economic Sanctions.
        You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and ${HOST} reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.
        
        11. Indemnification.
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ${HOST}, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.
        
        12. Translation.
        These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English version, the English version will control.
        
        13. Miscellaneous.
        This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between ${HOST} and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of ${HOST}, or by the posting by ${HOST} of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Diego County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Diego, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; ${HOST} may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
