# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        # Frequently Asked Questions
        
        ## General

        ### <a name="theory"></a>What is the theory of the categories?
        
        > ‚ÄòHappiness' is too worn and too weary a term to be of much scientific use, and the discipline of Positive Psychology divides it into three very different realms, each of which is measurable and, most importantly, each of which is skill-based and can be taught (Seligman, 2002). The first is hedonic: positive emotion (joy, love, contentment, pleasure etc.). A life led around having as much of this good stuff as possible, is the ‚ÄòPleasant Life'. The second, much closer to what Thomas Jefferson and Aristotle sought, is the state of flow, and a life led around it is the ‚ÄòEngaged Life'. Flow, a major part of the Engaged Life, consists in a loss of self-consciousness, time stopping for you, being ‚Äòone with the music' (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Importantly engagement seems to be the opposite of positive emotion: when one is totally absorbed, no thoughts or feelings are present‚Äîeven though one says afterwards ‚Äòthat was fun' (Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005). And while there are shortcuts to positive emotion‚Äîyou can take drugs, masturbate, watch television, or go shopping‚Äîthere are no shortcuts to flow. Flow only occurs when you deploy your highest strengths and talents to meet the challenges that come your way, and it is clear that flow facilitates learning. The third realm in the framework of Positive Psychology is the one with the best intellectual provenance, the Meaningful Life. Flow and positive emotion can be found in solipsistic pursuits, but not meaning or purpose. Meaning is increased through our connections to others, future generations, or causes that transcend the self (Durkheim, 1951/1897; Erikson, 1963). From a Positive Psychology perspective, meaning consists in knowing what your highest strengths are, and then using them to belong to and serve something you believe is larger than the self (Seligman, 2002).

        ### What is the purpose of the points system?
        
        The points system is an experiment to try to help people balance the three dimensions of happiness mentioned above.
        
        ### How safe is my data?
        
        Regarding the availability of your data, it is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is asynchronously but nearly instantaneously streamed to a backup database (see [our architecture](https://github.com/myplaceonline/myplaceonline/blob/master/doc/Development.md#architecture)). If the main database server crashes, your data will most likely be safe. The only potential danger of losing your data is if something happens to the entire [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) San Francisco data center because the architecture is currently limited to a single data center.
        
        If you are concerned that your data is stored in the United States, you may use symmetric encryption for certain sensitive data (see the `Security` section below), or run the website locally.
        
        ## <a name="security"></a>Security
        
        ### How are website passwords managed?
        
        We never store your website password on our servers. A bcrypt [hash and salt](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) for the password is stored and used to authenticate you. Your password is stored in an [encrypted and signed form in your cookie](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CookieStore.html). This is needed because your password is used to decrypt any values you chose to encrypt, and asking you for your password every time something needs to be decrypted would be annoying.
        
        When you change your password, we symmetrically decrypt all encrypted values and then re-encrypt them with the new password. This can take a long time if you have a lot of encrypted values.
        
        ### How is encryption used?
        
        You may optionally encrypt some sensitive information, usually by checking an `Encrypt` checkbox when creating or editing certain items such as passwords (this box is checked by default). This protects that data from the following attacks (assuming your password is hard to discover using a brute force search):
        
        * If a malicious person hacks the Myplaceonline database.
        * If a Myplaceonline administrator reads the database.
        * If another Myplaceonline user accesses your data by exploiting a bug in the website to access your data (the reason this fails is that even if the user accesses your data, unless you both happened to use the same password, the decryption will return garbage).
        
        ### How is data encrypted when stored in the database or in offline browser storage?

        Symmetric [AES-256-CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and a [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)+HMAC+SHA1 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### How is data encrypted when exported?

        When [exporting all of your data](/users/export) into a downloadable file, you may optionally encrypt the file using symmetric [AES-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and an [S2K](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)+SHA512 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### What are the issues with "at-rest" encryption?
        
        At-rest encryption uses your main Myplaceonline.com website password to encrypt the data in the database using a [symmetric cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) (see above). This means that if you forget your main Myplaceonline.com website password, you will not be able to recover those encrypted values (because only you had the key). The "forgot my password" function on websites simply resets your password to a new password after you click a link in an email. There is no such thing as a "forgot my password" function for symmetric encryption.
        
        ### If I sign out of Myplaceonline, why are all my other devices also signed out?
        
        This is a security feature. If you want to stay logged in on other devices, then do not use the sign out feature; instead, on the devices that you want to sign out of, do not check the "Remember Me" box when signing in, and simply close the browser when you want to sign out. This will sign you out on just that device.

        ## Sharing
        
        You may share a trip and its pictures through email:
        
        1. Create a [trip](/trips/new) and give it a location and start date.
        Add one or more pictures to the trip. After saving, click the `Share`
        button at the bottom. For example:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/create_trip1.png}
        
        1. Select which pictures to share. By default, all pictures are
        shared. When finished selecting, click the `Share` button at the
        bottom:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share1.png}
        
        1. Enter a subject and body of the email. For the subject, we recommend
        starting it with `Name Shared: `, and we'll add that by default. The
        reason for this is that the email will come from this website
        so it may be useful for the recipient to quickly know who sent the email
        without having to check it. For the body, you may use the
        placeholder `%{name}` which will be replaced by the contact name.
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share2.png}
        
        1. If you plan to share with the same group of people in the future,
        create a group:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share4.png}
        
        1. Click `New Group` and enter a group name (next time, search for
        this name in the `Existing Group` box):
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share5.png}
        
        1. Add as many contacts as you want. For each contact, click
        `New Contact`, enter at least a first name, and then add one or more
        email addresses (this is where the system will send the emails).
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share6.png}
        
        1. Instead of using groups, you can add individual contacts as well.
        These are not mutually exclusive, so you can select one or more groups
        as well as one or more contacts, and emails will be sent to all of them.
        Click `Share` at the bottom when ready.
        
        1. On the next page, you may uncheck any contacts that you do not
        want to email. This is useful if you use a group and you want to
        exclude some people for some reason. In addition, you can add a
        personalization to any checked person and this additional text will
        be put at the bottom of the email just for that person. Click `Share`
        when complete:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share7.png}
        
        1. In about 5 minutes, the emails will be sent to the contacts.
        Remember that we cannot guarantee email delivery. Even if you
        blind carbon copy yourself and receive a copy, we do not track email
        opens so you can never be sure the email arrived or was opened. The
        email will be addressed from our domain although a `Reply-To`
        is setup so that if the person clicks reply, they will automatically
        reply to your email address. The user will have a link to the shared
        trip view. This link has a unique token so that only they, or anyone
        they forward the link to, can see the page. Thumbnails of the images
        will also be included in the HTML version of the email. The user
        is able to unsubscribe from `Trip` emails or all emails from you.
        By default, the signature at the bottom will only include your email
        address. If you want your name and/or phone numbers in the signature,
        go to the [contacts](/contacts) page and click on the `Me` button
        to edit your contact.

      # Privacy Policy

      Your privacy is critically important to us. At ${HOST} we have a few fundamental principles:

      * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
      * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
      * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
      * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control your data visibility. By default, data you enter is private and only you can see what you input. Any data you delete is permanently deleted from our systems.

      Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, this page is based on [Automattic's](https://automattic.com/privacy/) Creative Commons Sharealike privacy policy)

      If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact](/info/contact) our support team.

      It is ${HOST}'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
      
      ## Website Visitors

      Like most website operators, ${HOST} collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ${HOST}'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ${HOST}'s visitors use its website. From time to time, ${HOST} may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

      ${HOST} also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. ${HOST} only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
      
      ## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

      Certain visitors to ${HOST}'s websites choose to interact with ${HOST} in ways that require ${HOST} to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ${HOST} gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at ${HOST}.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with ${HOST} are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ${HOST} collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with ${HOST}. ${HOST} does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
      
      ## Aggregated Statistics

      ${HOST} may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. ${HOST} may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ${HOST} does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
      
      ## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

      ${HOST} discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ${HOST}'s behalf or to provide services available at ${HOST}'s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ${HOST}'s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ${HOST} will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ${HOST} discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ${HOST} believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ${HOST}, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of ${HOST}, ${HOST} may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ${HOST} and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. ${HOST} takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
      
      ## Cookies

      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ${HOST} uses cookies to help ${HOST} identify and track visitors, their usage of ${HOST} website, and their website access preferences. ${HOST} visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ${HOST}'s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ${HOST}'s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
      
      ## Business Transfers

      If ${HOST}, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ${HOST} goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ${HOST} may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
      
      ## Privacy Policy Changes

      Although most changes are likely to be minor, ${HOST} may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in ${HOST}'s sole discretion. ${HOST} will send an email to all registered members when this happens and maintain a change log at the bottom of this page.

        # Terms of Service
        
        <h2>The gist</h2>

        We (the folks at ${HOST}) run an online helper website called ${HOST} and would love for you to use it. ${HOST}'s basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features.

        (Note, this page is based on [Wordpress.com's](https://en.wordpress.com/tos/) Creative Commons Sharealike terms of service)
        
        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

        The following terms and conditions govern all use of the ${HOST} website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website (taken together, our Services). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, ${HOST}'s Privacy Policy). ${HOST} may change its Terms of Service from time to time, and in ${HOST}'s sole discretion. ${HOST} will send an email to all registered members when this happens and maintain a change log at the bottom of this page.

        Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by ${HOST}, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.

        Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.

        Use of our Services requires a ${HOST} account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.
        
        1. ${HOST}.
        * Your ${HOST} Account and Website. If you create an account on ${HOST}, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must immediately notify ${HOST} of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. ${HOST} will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
        * Responsibility of Contributors. If you post material ("Content") to ${HOST}.com and mark it as public, you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that your content does not violate these terms or the User Guidelines. If you delete Content, ${HOST} will use reasonable efforts to remove it from ${HOST}.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, ${HOST} has the right (though not the obligation) to, in ${HOST}'s sole discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of ${HOST}.com to any individual or entity for any reason. ${HOST} will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
        * Payment and Renewal.
          * General Terms: Optional paid services are available (any such services, an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay ${HOST} the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
          * Automatic Renewal: Unless you notify ${HOST} before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your website's dashboard.

        2. Responsibility of Visitors.
        ${HOST} has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By operating our Services, ${HOST} does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. ${HOST} disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.
        
        3. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.
        If you believe that material located on or linked to by ${HOST}.com violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify ${HOST}. ${HOST} will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. ${HOST} will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ${HOST} or others. In the case of such termination, ${HOST} will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to ${HOST}.
        
        4. Intellectual Property.
        This Agreement does not transfer from ${HOST} to you any ${HOST} or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with ${HOST}. ${HOST}, ${HOST}.com, the ${HOST}.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with ${HOST}.com or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of ${HOST} or ${HOST}'s licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any ${HOST} or third-party trademarks.
        
        5. Changes.
        We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
        
        6. Termination.
        ${HOST} may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If possible, we will notify you and offer your data for offline download. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your ${HOST}.com account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services or delete your account under settings. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranties.
        Our Services are provided "as is." ${HOST} and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither ${HOST} nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.
        In no event will ${HOST}, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to ${HOST} under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. ${HOST} shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
        
        9. General Representation and Warranty.
        You represent and warrant that (i) your use of our Services will be in strict accordance with the ${HOST} Privacy Policy, with this Agreement, and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of our Services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.
        
        10. US Economic Sanctions.
        You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and ${HOST} reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.
        
        11. Indemnification.
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ${HOST}, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.
        
        12. Translation.
        These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English version, the English version will control.
        
        13. Miscellaneous.
        This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between ${HOST} and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of ${HOST}, or by the posting by ${HOST} of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Diego County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Diego, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; ${HOST} may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
