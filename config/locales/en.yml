# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        # Frequently Asked Questions
        
        ## General

        ### <a name="theory"></a>What is the theory of the categories?
        
        > ‘Happiness' is too worn and too weary a term to be of much scientific use, and the discipline of Positive Psychology divides it into three very different realms, each of which is measurable and, most importantly, each of which is skill-based and can be taught (Seligman, 2002). The first is hedonic: positive emotion (joy, love, contentment, pleasure etc.). A life led around having as much of this good stuff as possible, is the ‘Pleasant Life'. The second, much closer to what Thomas Jefferson and Aristotle sought, is the state of flow, and a life led around it is the ‘Engaged Life'. Flow, a major part of the Engaged Life, consists in a loss of self-consciousness, time stopping for you, being ‘one with the music' (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Importantly engagement seems to be the opposite of positive emotion: when one is totally absorbed, no thoughts or feelings are present—even though one says afterwards ‘that was fun' (Delle Fave & Massimini, 2005). And while there are shortcuts to positive emotion—you can take drugs, masturbate, watch television, or go shopping—there are no shortcuts to flow. Flow only occurs when you deploy your highest strengths and talents to meet the challenges that come your way, and it is clear that flow facilitates learning. The third realm in the framework of Positive Psychology is the one with the best intellectual provenance, the Meaningful Life. Flow and positive emotion can be found in solipsistic pursuits, but not meaning or purpose. Meaning is increased through our connections to others, future generations, or causes that transcend the self (Durkheim, 1951/1897; Erikson, 1963). From a Positive Psychology perspective, meaning consists in knowing what your highest strengths are, and then using them to belong to and serve something you believe is larger than the self (Seligman, 2002).

        ### What is the purpose of the points system?
        
        The points system is an experiment to try to help people balance the three dimensions of happiness mentioned above.
        
        ### How safe is my data?
        
        Regarding the availability of your data, it is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is asynchronously but nearly instantaneously streamed to a backup database (see [our architecture](https://github.com/myplaceonline/myplaceonline/blob/master/doc/Development.md#architecture)). If the main database server crashes, your data will most likely be safe. The only potential danger of losing your data is if something happens to the entire [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) San Francisco data center because the architecture is currently limited to a single data center.
        
        If you are concerned that your data is stored in the United States, you may use symmetric encryption for certain sensitive data (see the `Security` section below), or run the website locally.
        
        ## <a name="security"></a>Security
        
        ### How are website passwords managed?
        
        We never store your website password on our servers. A bcrypt [hash and salt](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet) for the password is stored and used to authenticate you. Your password is stored in an [encrypted and signed form in your cookie](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CookieStore.html). This is needed because your password is used to decrypt any values you chose to encrypt, and asking you for your password every time something needs to be decrypted would be annoying.
        
        When you change your password, we symmetrically decrypt all encrypted values and then re-encrypt them with the new password. This can take a long time if you have a lot of encrypted values.
        
        ### How is encryption used?
        
        You may optionally encrypt some sensitive information, usually by checking an `Encrypt` checkbox when creating or editing an item. This protects that data from the following attacks:
        
        * If a malicious person hacks the myplaceonline servers.
        * If a rogue myplaceonline administrator reads the database.
        * If another myplaceonline user accesses your data by exploiting a bug in the server code (the reason this works is that even if the user accesses your data, unless you both happened to use the same password, the decryption will return garbage).
        
        ### How is data encrypted when stored in the database or in offline browser storage?

        Symmetric [AES-256-CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and a [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)+HMAC+SHA1 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### How is data encrypted when exported?

        When [exporting all of your data](/users/export) into a downloadable file, you may optionally encrypt the file using symmetric [AES-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and an [S2K](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880)+SHA512 key derivation function with an 8 byte salt and 65536 iterations.
        
        ### Why isn't encryption enabled by default?
        
        If you choose to encrypt certain values, we encrypt them with your password using a [symmetric cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm). This means that if you forget your password, you will not be able to recover those encrypted values (because only you had the key). The "forgot my password" function on websites simply resets your password to a new password after you click a link in an email. There is no such thing as a "forgot my password" function for symmetric encryption. For these reasons, we don't encrypt by default as many users might not understand these risks right away.
        
        An alternative to this would be to perform encryption and decryption on the client side.

        ## Sharing
        
        You may share a trip and its pictures through email:
        
        1. Create a [trip](/trips/new) and give it a location and start date.
        Add one or more pictures to the trip. After saving, click the `Share`
        button at the bottom. For example:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/create_trip1.png}
        
        1. Select which pictures to share. By default, all pictures are
        shared. When finished selecting, click the `Share` button at the
        bottom:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share1.png}
        
        1. Enter a subject and body of the email. For the subject, we recommend
        starting it with `Name Shared: `, and we'll add that by default. The
        reason for this is that the email will come from `Myplaceonline.com`
        so it may be useful for the recipient to quickly know who sent the email
        without having to check it. For the body, you may use the
        placeholder `%{name}` which will be replaced by the contact name.
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share2.png}
        
        1. If you plan to share with the same group of people in the future,
        create a group:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share4.png}
        
        1. Click `New Group` and enter a group name (next time, search for
        this name in the `Existing Group` box):
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share5.png}
        
        1. Add as many contacts as you want. For each contact, click
        `New Contact`, enter at least a first name, and then add one or more
        email addresses (this is where the system will send the emails).
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share6.png}
        
        1. Instead of using groups, you can add individual contacts as well.
        These are not mutually exclusive, so you can select one or more groups
        as well as one or more contacts, and emails will be sent to all of them.
        Click `Share` at the bottom when ready.
        
        1. On the next page, you may uncheck any contacts that you do not
        want to email. This is useful if you use a group and you want to
        exclude some people for some reason. In addition, you can add a
        personalization to any checked person and this additional text will
        be put at the bottom of the email just for that person. Click `Share`
        when complete:
        
            {image:help/categories/trips/share7.png}
        
        1. In about 5 minutes, the emails will be sent to the contacts.
        Remember that myplaceonline cannot guarantee email delivery. Even if you
        blind carbon copy yourself and receive a copy, we do not track email
        opens so you can never be sure the email arrived or was opened. The
        email will be addressed from `Myplaceonline.com` although a `Reply-To`
        is setup so that if the person clicks reply, they will automatically
        reply to your email address. The user will have a link to the shared
        trip view. This link has a unique token so that only they, or anyone
        they forward the link to, can see the page. Thumbnails of the images
        will also be included in the HTML version of the email. The user
        is able to unsubscribe from `Trip` emails or all emails from you.
        By default, the signature at the bottom will only include your email
        address. If you want your name and/or phone numbers in the signature,
        go to the [contacts](/contacts) page and click on the `Me` button
        to edit your contact.

      # Privacy Policy

      Your privacy is critically important to us. At myplaceonline we have a few fundamental principles:

      * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
      * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
      * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
      * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control your data visibility. By default, data you enter is private and only you can see what you input. Any data you delete is permanently deleted from our systems.

      Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, this page is based on [Automattic's](https://automattic.com/privacy/) Creative Commons Sharealike privacy policy)

      If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact](/info/contact) our support team.

      It is myplaceonline's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
      
      ## Website Visitors

      Like most website operators, myplaceonline collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. myplaceonline's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how myplaceonline's visitors use its website. From time to time, myplaceonline may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

      myplaceonline also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. myplaceonline only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
      
      ## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

      Certain visitors to myplaceonline's websites choose to interact with myplaceonline in ways that require myplaceonline to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that myplaceonline gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at myplaceonline.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with myplaceonline are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, myplaceonline collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with myplaceonline. myplaceonline does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
      
      ## Aggregated Statistics

      myplaceonline may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. myplaceonline may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, myplaceonline does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
      
      ## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

      myplaceonline discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on myplaceonline's behalf or to provide services available at myplaceonline's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using myplaceonline's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. myplaceonline will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, myplaceonline discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when myplaceonline believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of myplaceonline, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of myplaceonline, myplaceonline may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with myplaceonline and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. myplaceonline takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
      
      ## Cookies

      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. myplaceonline uses cookies to help myplaceonline identify and track visitors, their usage of myplaceonline website, and their website access preferences. myplaceonline visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using myplaceonline's websites, with the drawback that certain features of myplaceonline's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
      
      ## Business Transfers

      If myplaceonline, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that myplaceonline goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of myplaceonline may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
      
      ## Privacy Policy Changes

      Although most changes are likely to be minor, myplaceonline may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in myplaceonline's sole discretion. myplaceonline will send an email to all registered members when this happens and maintain a change log at the bottom of this page.
